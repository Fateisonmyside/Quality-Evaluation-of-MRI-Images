# Quality Evaluation of Brain MRI Images

This project focuses on the quality assessment of Brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a CNN model that evaluates the quality of Brain MRI images by assessing the presence of removed facial features and unintentionally eliminated brain tissues. The model aims to determine whether the facial features are removed to an extent that the individual cannot be identified based on the remaining features. It also detects any unintentional removal of brain tissues, which could result in a loss of crucial brain data.
